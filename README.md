# MyMathQuiz app-

Android studio app that I've created as a final project in CS degree.
The app is an educational game, focuses on improving simple math knowledge.
The app is designed mainly for kids, but anyone can enjoy the competition and challenge himself.

There are two types of levels- 
  1. Single player level - each level focuses on arithmetic function (summation, substraction etc.)
  2. Dual level - a game between two players. The winner is the player that will get a highest score.
 
Hope you enjoy it!
